# depth_first_traversal

* Starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.  
* Moved to the adjacent unmarked node and continue this loop until there is no unmarked adjacent nodes.  
* Then backtrack and check for other unmarked nodes and traverse them.
